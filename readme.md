# Efficient Bayesian Learning Curve Extrapolation using Prior-Data Fitted Networks

This repository offers an implementation of LC-PFN, a method designed for efficient Bayesian learning curve extrapolation.

### Installation

To set up the Python environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Create and activate a new Python environment:
```shell
conda create -n lcpfn python=3.9
conda activate lcpfn
```

2. Clone the repository and navigate into its directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:automl/lcpfn.git
cd lcpfn
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

For examples of training an LC-PFN model and using it for inference, check out the `notebooks` directory.
